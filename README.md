# Research_CV_Template
A clean and crisp [CV](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~kusupati/links/CV.html) template built over time by [Aditya Kusupati](http://www.adityakusupati.com/) on top of Theodore P. Pavlic's original class file.

Works seamlessly in online LaTeX editors just by uploading the tex/zip file or can be compiled using the Makefile which only needs pdflatex.

This CV template contains multiple usecases, across sections, that are helpful and can be easily adapted as needed. These might not be in my actual CV, but I have used them at various stages during the development of the template and found them to be useful.

Anyone can use this template for non-commercial use: which basically covers most of the cases we use our CVs. Share it with your peers!!
